Palantype DE
=======================

See [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

This is a complete rework of the Possum Palantype steno system for efficient
use with the German language.
Its intended use is with a keyboard, not an actual Palantype machine.
Each finger operates three keys: Home row, top and bottom.
The thumbs are exceptions, they operate four keys.
There is no simultaneous pressing of multiple keys with one finger.

![The Palantype DE keyboard layout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rubenmoor/palantype_DE/main/keyboard_layout.png)

Like the original Palantype, this adaption is compatible with
Qwerty-keyboards as long as they support N-key roll-over (NKRO).
The optimal experience is to be expected with a keyboard that allows full use of the thumbs.
`Palantype DE` relies on four thumb keys.
Here are examples for such a keyboard:

* [Keyboardio Model 100](https://shop.keyboard.io/products/model-100)
* [Keyboardio Atreus](https://shop.keyboard.io/collections/keyboardio-atreus/products/keyboardio-atreus)
* [ZSA Moonlander Mark I](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/)
* [Ergodox EZ](https://ergodox-ez.com/)
* [YAEMK](https://karlk90.github.io/yaemk-split-kb/)

How to use
======================

Quick start
----------------------

Head over to [palantype.com](https://palantype.com) to get started right away in
the browser.

Offline use with Plover
----------------------

This is a plugin for the software Plover from
[The Open Steno Project](http://www.openstenoproject.org/).
Download the
[latest version of Plover](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover/releases/tag/v4.0.0.dev10).
Plover supports plugins from v4.0.0 on.

After installing this plugin, you need to turn on Palantype in Plover:

1. In Plover's configuration, go to the ``Systems`` tab, and change the active system to ``Palantype DE``.
2. In Plover's machine tab, select ``keyboard``.

Run in browser
----------------------

Currently, only the tutorial is implemented at [palantype.com](https://palantype.com).
Learning to type requires a lot of practice,
therefore it is recommended starting there in any case.

In future, [palantype.com](https://palantype.com) will also offer
an on-line text editor for steno typing.

Current state
=====================

The dictionary contains almost 2,000,000 words of the German language.
There are built-in already some essential features for real-life steno typing:

* fingerspelling
* command keys (e.g. arrow keys, home, end, ...)
* numbers
* special keys
* plover commands (e.g. retroactively capitalize)

These features are implemented in the dictionary files

* `palantype-DE-extra.json`, and
* `palantype-DE-numbers.json`.


Development
=====================

Source code
-------------------------

You can find all relevant code on Github:

* The plover plugin [plover-palantype-DE](https://github.com/rubenmoor/palantype_DE)
* The palantype Haskell library [mypalantype](https://github.com/rubenmoor/my-palantype)
* [Palantype tools](https://github.com/rubenmoor/palantype-tools), to create your own palantype-style steno system
* The code of the project home page with all the tutorials [Palantype.com codebase](https://github.com/rubenmoor/learn-palantype)

You can get an overview of what I am working on, on the [Kanban board of the project](https://github.com/users/rubenmoor/projects/2).
Feel free to post issues on any of those repositories with questions and/or feedback.

Getting your hands dirty
--------------------------

Test the plugin locally

    $ plover -s plover_plugins install -e .
    $ plover

Publish new version

    $ nix-shell

Follow the instructions inside the nix shell.
